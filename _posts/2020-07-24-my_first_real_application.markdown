I wanted this project to be somthing more personal to me. I was diagnosed with MS at the start of the flatiron bootcamp, I had been meeting with neurologists and was connected with a nonprofit centered around helping newly diagnosed ms patients thrive. One of the things they where dreaming about was an online space they could have medical professionals (educators) post content tailord to their clients needs. Fitting considering I need just such education. So my Aplication is a place where educators can post content to their patients home page and patients could journal about their day to day experiences. Im also working to include a card where patients can create appointment reminders. so each patients have one provider and providers have many patients. each patient has many posts and educators have many educational posts. The hardest part of the project was intermingling the materialize framework and learning to style the pages. I found the idea of moving from one train-station to another a helpful analogy when thinking about the controller actions. It helped me to remember what I am bringing along with me each time I head to a view and return from one. The project wet my apatite for web development and im excited to continue! P.S. Active record is Amazing!
