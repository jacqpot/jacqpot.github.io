As a little lad I dreampt of space travel and exploring the great unknown. I loved cowboy movies and adventures in the woods near my house. I loved how each hero figure could problem solve and overcome any obstacle. I learned from characters like Davy Crockett, the three musketeers, Colonel O'neil, Mcgyvver and Clint Eastwood. Although learning to manage, create, and manipulate the web isn't quite like these adventures. It's the wild frontier in this season of my life. My Dad and Godfather both migrated to the united states from South Africa as COBOL programmers.  I watched them type total gibberish for hours at a time, always wondering but never asking what was happening.

Like my parents who picked up their lives and moved to the united states I'm setting out for my own adventure. After receiving a diagnosis of MS and leaving my career skills as a carpenter behind, I've decided to learn a new skill. Much like the characters that raised me, I am choosing to take the challenge and adversity of life in stride. I've been playing around with html and css in my free time but am excited for some structure. Like most hero's setting out on adventure, I'm excited, daunted and wondering how I will succeed. I'm reminded that the heroes in star wars almost never go it alone. Neither will I, I'm glad to have a cohort of flatiron students learning and growing together. Like Frodo Bagins and Sam-wise Gamge We set out together, unsure of whats to come but encouraged by the company we keep.
