As a Carpenter I learned to engage in the craft with an open mind, there is always someone who had done it longer. The danger for me is in thinking that I’ve learned enough.  Similarly and maybe even more so, life as a developer is a life of learning new languages and concepts, expanding your depth of understanding and trying new things. 

# Fixed mindsets won’t cut it

There are Many resources to develop one’s skill and ability that are a lot cheaper than developing the craft  of carpentry. As a carpenter, I had to purchase new tools and lumber to experiment with new join methods and techniques. But as a developer our brain, a computer and an internet connection is all we need. So much is at our fingertips. 

During flatiron academy I learned so much through the curriculum, but beyond that I learned how to find answers browsing the web. Not only does each language and framework have great documentation, but so many professionals are teaching concepts on mediums like youtube and  medium.com. The answers are out there, It’s the Developers job to find them. That’s our job… finding answers.

During the first mile of flatiron's curriculum I was encouraged to challenge the way I saw myself and the learning process. I was raised with the idea that if I couldn't figure out something right away, it was because I wasn't smart enough. That mentality is of course... a lie. It is also a fatal mistake for people trying to make it as a developer. When Learning a new language or starting a project It is so easy to get lost in what you don't yet know. "I can't do that" and "I cant figure this out" are the killers of growth and productivity. I know it sounds simple, but try replacing those frases with "I've not done that before" and "I haven't figured this out yet"  this changes the mindset from being unable to being in process. 

# Stages of learning

During a training stint I was exposed to a behavior change model that I think applies to learning as well.  Here are the four stages of learning.


1. unconscious incompetence
2. conscious incompetence
3. conscious competence
4. unconscious competence

When starting the Flatiron bootcamp most of us are unconsiously incompetent, meaning that we dont know that we dont know. Then during each mod we become aware of another concept, language or framework that we don't actually understand or know how to utilize. With each mod another skillset gets added to the conscious competence category. Meaning that you have been exposed to a concept, are aware of  a big picture but need a lot of practice to feel really comfortable and are able to get into a flow state.  so dont give up, when it feels hard. remember that It always takes a level of intentionality and effort to go from conscious compentence to unconscious competence. 

# Dont give up on yourself

Coding is hard, and learning takes time. so be patient with your learning experience. Learning is a journey not a destination. All good stories tell us that journeys come with highs and lows, good moments and bad ones. So embrace the suck and keep on going.
