<p>I've spent my professional career as a carpenter and residential remodeler. As I journey through a set of medical challenges I've decided to dive into a subject I've been exposed to my whole life... Software engineering.  I'm excited to learn and create with this new medium. I hope to pass on some of my experience as I stumble through new languages and learning strategies. </p>
